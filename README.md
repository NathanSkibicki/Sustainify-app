## A Greener and Smarter Way to Save the Planet

## Inspiration 🌎

Each person produces 4.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year worldwide. This is roughly the size of an adult African elephant in just CO2 gas. Carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas which causes global warming. Since 1961 humanity’s carbon footprint has increased over eleven times. This Hack The Valley our team wanted to innovate saving the environment using AI.

## What it does 🤔

Sustainify is a web app where users can track their carbon footprint usage and gain meaningful feedback on their emission habits using AI. The user is prompted to complete a short survey, the survey consists of questions related to the user's household, transportation, and consumption practices. Once met the results get processed into our language model to give intelligent recommendations on how the user can improve on reducing emissions. 

Sustainify also provides insights into how your habits compare to those of other users, showcasing the distinctions in your data. If your habits change you can retake the survey to get a new rating. 

But wait that's not all, with Sustainify we incorporate our very own chatbot, Eco! Eco is our cute and friendly mascot who will answer any of your questions related to the environment. For example, we can ask Eco “How can I reduce my carbon emissions if I am a frequent automobile driver?”. Then Eco will provide a variety of solutions to your problem. Be aware though that Eco will only answer questions related to sustainability. So if we ask Eco, “Who is the president of the United States?”, Eco will not answer us.

## How we built it 🛠️

Sustainify was built with Flask and OpenAI API for the back-end, React, Tailwind CSS, FireBase, and JavaScript, CSS/HTML for the front end, we used FireStore for the database, and we hosted our web app on sustainifytheworld.tech.

## Challenges we ran into ⚠️

One of the biggest challenges we ran into was trying to get our AI's responses to connect to the front-end so that the users can see the response. After a few hours we were able to resolve the issue.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏆

We're really proud of integrating AI into our project. No one on our team previously knew how to work with AI but in the short span of 36 hours, we were able to create our own chatbot and use AI to give smart recommendations to users.

## What's next for Sustainify ➡️❓

Our next steps for Sustainify is to turn it into a game and make saving the environment fun. The less you emit the more points you get and you can compete against your family and friends.
